# Top Places

This app allows users to view Flickr photos from top location spots. It can work in both iPhone and iPad devices. 

To use it, clone the repository and sign up a Flickr API key. Then, insert your key in the file FlickrAPIKey.h between the quotes. The app should then work in xcode or on a device.
